# statmet14-train

A statistical model of a train running on a track with unknown switch settings,
receiving possibly faulty signals.

Implements MCMC using Metropolis-Hastings to analyse true switch settings
based on observations, and also in some sense a HMM.

Generates a plot of how the prediction changes.
